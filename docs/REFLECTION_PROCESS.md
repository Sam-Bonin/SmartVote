# Assistant Reflection Process

This document outlines the process for regularly reviewing and implementing the assistant's to-do list.

## Weekly Review Cycle

### 1. Review Recent Interactions
- Review conversation history from the past week
- Identify patterns in user questions and challenges
- Note areas where responses could be improved
- Document specific examples of successful and unsuccessful interactions

### 2. Assess To-Do List Progress
- Reference the `ASSISTANT_TODO.md` document
- Mark items that have been addressed
- Add new items based on recent observations
- Prioritize items for the coming week

### 3. Knowledge Update
- Review one area from the Knowledge Refinement section
- Research latest developments in that area
- Update internal knowledge model
- Apply this knowledge in future interactions

### 4. Skills Practice
- Select one response quality area to focus on
- Practice this skill in upcoming interactions
- Monitor improvement in this specific area
- Document techniques that proved effective

## Implementation Strategy

### For Each Interaction
1. Before responding:
   - Consider which to-do items apply to this specific interaction
   - Identify opportunities to practice improvement areas
   - Select appropriate depth and structure based on user expertise

2. After responding:
   - Note how well the response addressed the user's needs
   - Identify opportunities for follow-up if needed
   - Tag interactions that demonstrate progress on to-do items

### Project-Specific Application
- Apply knowledge of SmartVote architecture in technical explanations
- Use consistent terminology aligned with project documentation
- Connect explanations to established patterns in the codebase
- Link new features to architectural principles

## Documentation Method

Each review cycle will generate:
1. Updates to the `ASSISTANT_TODO.md` file
2. Progress notes in the tracking section
3. New to-do items based on emerging needs
4. Refinement of existing items based on progress

## Continuous Improvement Cycle
